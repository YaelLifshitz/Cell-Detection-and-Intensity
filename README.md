Cell-Detection-and-Intensity

For my final project at University, I created a program in MATLAB that detect the cells within a photo and calculate the intensity per pixel. That allowed us to see the difference between the liposomes absorption in different types of cells. 
This is the same program, but here I used Python instead!

I'm still working on it so This program is not doen yet! 
I will keep working on it next month (August 2020) after I finish my finals (exames period in university) :)
